## InteractionGroup: Energy-decomposition module


InteractionGroup is a Python-based module for the energy decomposition of molecular dynamics simulation trajectories. Decomposing the nonbonded energy in various chemical systems rainging from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials is essential to the deeper understanding of molecular phenomena. 

Considering that the only total energy value is given in the energy logfile, accessing the interaction energy between specific group of atoms would be highly informative. This module read, and analyze MD trajectories with only a few lines of Python code to do so.

> [!NOTE]\
> This module currently works only with a simulation package [openMM](https://github.com/openmm/openmm) version>7.5.  

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Crucial information necessary for users to succeed.

> [!WARNING]\
> Critical content demanding immediate user attention due to potential risks.
